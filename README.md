# C# Console Coding Projects

The multitude of different console programs I've made through my time using C#

These should be opened in Visual Studio - The iteration of said application that I originally coded them within was the 2010 Edition, but I have tested these in the 2015 Community Edition and within this parameter, they all seemed to run efficiently and without issues.

I hope you enjoy looking through these programs and if you have any queries then please leave a comment and feel free to enquire!
