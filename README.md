## C# Console Coding Projects

The multitude of different console programs I've made through my time using C#

These should be opened in **Visual Studio** - The iteration of said application that I originally coded them within was the **2010 Edition**, but I have tested these in the **2015 Community Edition** and within this *parameter*, they all seemed to *run efficiently* and *without issues*.

I hope you enjoy looking through these programs and if you have any queries then please leave a comment and feel free to enquire!


All of this code was written by me, Niall Ashley.

Below are where updates for this code will be stored, regarding compatability issues as well as logic and syntax errors:
